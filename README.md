# SpaceX-Clone

I made ths website using HTML, CSS, Javacript and Bootstrap5 for giving it the responsive design.
Responsiveness is still not totally completed for all the screen, and is properly visible to big screens.

This basically for the front-end desing copy of the website and backend is not yet introduced to this project.

And this is it for the website, as of this date, the project I started on 27th of July 2022 and is based on the design of that period. It might be possible that there will be certain changes in the SpaceX website as of now.
